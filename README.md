Groth16 is a zk-SNARK (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) protocol designed for proving and verifying computations efficiently. zk-SNARKs allow one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that they know a value that satisfies a given computation, without revealing the value itself or any other information beyond the validity of the computation. Here are the key aspects of Groth16:
Key Features of Groth16

    Succinctness: The proofs generated are very small in size (typically a few hundred bytes), making them efficient to store and transmit.
    
    Non-Interactivity: The protocol is non-interactive, meaning that the prover can generate a proof without needing to interact with the verifier. This is achieved by using a common reference string (CRS) that both parties share.
    
    Zero-Knowledge: The proofs do not reveal any information about the witness (the secret data) other than the fact that it satisfies the computation.
    
    Efficiency: Verification of proofs is very fast, typically involving a few elliptic curve pairings and multiplications. This efficiency makes Groth16 suitable for applications in blockchain and other systems where performance is critical.

Plain Text to R1CS: Inputs are transformed into an R1CS, representing the computation in a constrained format.

R1CS to Polynomial (f(x)): The R1CS is then represented as polynomials.

Polynomials to Elliptic Curve Points: Polynomials are evaluated and mapped to points on an elliptic curve, which are then used in the zk-SNARK proof.

Proving with g(x): The prover demonstrates that their computed polynomial f(x)f(x) matches the expected polynomial g(x)g(x).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Initial Powers of Tau Setup:**
   - Run `snarkjs powersoftau new bn128 12 ceremony_0000.ptau -v` to initialize the initial Powers of Tau file.
   - Contribute entropy using `snarkjs powersoftau contribute ceremony_0000.ptau ceremony_0001.ptau -v` and `snarkjs powersoftau contribute ceremony_0001.ptau ceremony_0002.ptau -v`.
   - Verify the final Powers of Tau file with `snarkjs powersoftau verify ceremony_0002.ptau -v`.

2. **Phase 2 Randomness:**
   - Prepare Phase 2 with `snarkjs powersoftau prepare phase2 ceremony_0002.ptau ceremony_final.ptau -v`.
   - Verify the final Phase 2 Powers of Tau file with `snarkjs powersoftau verify ceremony_final.ptau -v`.

3. **Compile Circuit:**
   - Compile the circuit with `circom circuit.circom --r1cs --wasm`.

4. **Generate Proving Key:**
   - Generate the proving key with `snarkjs groth16 setup circuit.r1cs ceremony_final.ptau setup_0000.zkey`.
